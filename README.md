# Patient-Flow-Modeling-in-Hospital-Emergency-Departments-with-DES
This is the final project for the 'Discrete Events and Hybrid Systems' course taken at Boston University.

This study presents a discrete event simulation (DES) model developed using the SimPy library to model, analyze and enhance patient flow within an emergency department (ED) of a U.S. hospital.Recognizing the critical need for efficient healthcare delivery, especially in busy emergency settings, the model incorporates real-world data on patient arrivals and distributions to simulate daily operations accurately.    
The DES approach enables the identification of operational bottlenecks and the evaluation of various strategies to optimize resource allocation and patient throughput. By configuring different scenarios, this project highlights the key service areas where improvements can be made, thus improving the overall efficiency of the ED.
Key performance measures such as average waiting times, queue lengths, and service utilization rates across essential services: triage, doctor consultations, diagnostics, treatments, discharges, and admissions, were analyzed.   
These metrics are very important for understanding the dynamics of patient flow and for implementing effective management strategies.
The results from this simulation provide actionable insights that can improve patient management and satisfaction by reducing wait times and ensuring that critical resources are available when needed. This study demonstrates the practical applications of discrete event simulation technologies in healthcare settings, offering a tool for future enhancements in emergency department operations.
